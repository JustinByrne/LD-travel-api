# Project scope

## Goals
At the end, the project should have:

1. A private (admin) endpoint to create new users. If you want, this could also
be an artisan command, as you like. It will mainly be used to generate users for
this exercise;
2. A private (admin) endpoint to create new travels;
3. A private (admin) endpoint to create new tours for a travel;
4. A private (editor) endpoint to update a travel;
5. A public (no auth) endpoint to get a list of paginated travels. It must
return only public travels;
6. A public (no auth) endpoint to get a list of paginated tours by the travel
slug (e.g. all the tours of the travel foo-bar). Users can filter (search) the
results by priceFrom, priceTo, dateFrom (from that startingDate) and dateTo
(until that startingDate). User can sort the list by price asc and desc. They
will always be sorted, after every additional user-provided filter, by
startingDate asc.

## Models

### Users

- ID
- Email
- Password
- Roles (M2M relationship)

### Roles

- ID
- Name

### Travels

- ID
- Is Public (bool)
- Slug
- Name
- Description
- Number of days
- Number of nights (virtual, computed by numberOfDays - 1)

### Tours

- ID
- Travel ID (M2O relationship)
- Name
- Starting date
- Ending date
- Price (integer, see below)

## Notes

- Feel free to use the native Laravel authentication.
- We use UUIDs as primary keys instead of incremental IDs, but it's not required
for you to use them, although highly appreciated;
- Tours prices are integer multiplied by 100: for example, â‚¬999 euro will be
99900, but, when returned to Frontends, they will be formatted (99900 / 100);
- Every admin user will also have the editor role;
- Every creation endpoint, of course, should create one and only one resource.
You can't, for example, send an array of resource to create;
- Usage of php-cs-fixer and larastan are a plus;
- Creating docs is big plus;
- Feature tests are a big big plus.
